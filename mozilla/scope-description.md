Below are the sites that are considered in scope of the program, we would
like testing to focus on those sites. Other sites and services are considered
out of scope of the program unless the bug is critical. Critical bugs include
issues involving remote code execution, authentication and session management
flaws (which lead to account compromise), disclosure of secrets in publicly
accessible assets as well as hardcoded credentials for a privileged user.
