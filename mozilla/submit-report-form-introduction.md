You're about to submit a report to Mozilla. Provide as much information as possible about the potential issue you have discovered. The more information you provide, the quicker Mozilla will be able to validate the issue. If you haven't yet, please remember to review our [Security Page](https://hackerone.com/mozilla). Our program policy lists an extensive list of out of scope vulnerabilities, including [invalid reports which are frequently reported](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1830029).
